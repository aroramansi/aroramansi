Page Object Model using Selenium Automation

POM is basically a pattern, used for automation in which we creates Object Repository for web UI elements. It's advantage is that it actually reduces duplication of code and also improves the test maintenance.

In this project, we have created a corresponding page class for each web page in the application which were included in the created scenario. This pageclass helps to identufy the weblelements of the web page and also contains the page mehtods which helps to perform various operations on the web elements.
