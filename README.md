Page Object Model using Selenium Automation

Page Object Model (POM) is a design pattern, popularly used in test automation that creates Object Repository for web UI elements. The advantage of the model is that it reduces code duplication and improves test maintenance.

In this project, for each web page in the application, a corresponding Page Class is being created. This Page class will identify the WebElements of that web page and also contains Page methods which perform operations on those WebElements.
